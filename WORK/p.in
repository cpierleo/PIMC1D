## legenda:
mass = mass of the particle
omega = phonon frequency (hbaromega)
model = 1/2 [1=HO, 2=DW]
temp = temperature/hbaromega
nslices = number of time slices  (nslices/2==0 PIMC, nslices/2/=0 RQMC]
nblock = number of blocks for statistics
nstep = number of steps per block
nstart = flag to decide the way to start
         the code inquires the existence of a file qid.rs, if it exists
	 the positions of time slices are read from that file, otherwise
	 they are generated randomly around the origin.
	0 : start from scratch (as explained above)
	1 : continue a previous run, read positions and cumulators in qid.rs
       -1 : reanalize a previously saved set of configurations (qid.pc)
nmovers = numbers of time slices moved in a single MC attempt. 
nanal = calling frequency of analisys in step units
nbeg = initial block for cumulators
nalg = choose the MC algorithm to be used
      PIMC:
	0 : driver LEVY bisectes a nmovers imaginary time interval by free propagator
        3 : driver FPIMC local moves of normal modes
	4 : driver SMC Smart MC in the direct space
	5 : driver MC normal MC with gaussian displacement
	6 : driver SMC_NM Smart MC in the normal mode space
      RQMC:
	0 : driver REPTATE 
	1 : drive BOUNCE
nspill = frequency in steps of dumping confs. in file qid.pc
hop = maximum displacement for the single slice move
hop_cm = maximum displacement for the DISPLACE move
gammadsp = frequency of attempting the DISPLACE moves
hop_hmc = maximum displacement for the Hybrid_MC driver (not used)
nstdyn = number of steps of dynamics between Metrpoli tests in Hybrid_MC (not used)
iwigner = flag for activating Wigner dynamics [0=no, 1=yes]
whstep = time step for Wigner dynamics
nwsteps = number of steps of W dyn
iwave = ???
sigmap = ???
covarp = ???
level = new level for post analysis
